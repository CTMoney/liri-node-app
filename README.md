# Issues

    very wet code for Do What It Says
    does not filter out empty calls

-------------------------------

# In Action 

### First Call

![First Call | image]("#") *image*

  * Gives a list of options to choose from

![First Call | gif]("#") *gif*

  * Not much more to it
  
### Concert This!

![Concert This! image]("#") *image*

  * Shows Venue Information based on input

![Concert This! gif]("#") *gif*

  * Clears the terminal and then pushes ascii art + venue data formatted
  
 ### Spotify This!

![Spotify This! image]("#") *image*

 * Summarized Description

![Spotify This! gif]("#") *gif*

 * Full Description

### Movie This!

![Movie This! image]("#") *image*

  * Shows Movie Information based on input

![Movie This! gif]("#") *gif*

  * Clears the terminal and then pushes ascii art + movie data formatted
  
### Do What It Says!

![Do What It Says! image]("#") *image*

  * Summarized Description

![Do What It Says! gif]("#") *gif*

  * Full Description

# Notes / Comments

* Workflow will get bogged down by poor planning
* It's very easy to get lost in scope creep
* Dependencies become a nightmare eventually
